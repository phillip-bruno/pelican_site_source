# Data Engineer and Leader

I'm a data expert with years of experience under my belt. My main passions are developing ETL solutions, building business intelligence tools, and digging into reporting analytics to uncover insights.

I love working closely with clients - both inside and outside our company - to identify new opportunities and make them happen. When I'm not doing that, you can find me helping out my teammates, whether it's teaching them new skills or just being a sounding board for their ideas. Over the years, I've focused on streamlining processes and finding ways to automate tasks, which has saved us tons of time and money. It's been a blast, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next!
