## Hobbies

- 3D Printing
    - I'm an enthusiastic 3D printing hobbyist, I like to tinker and mess around with different digital designs. This hobby allows me to combine my creativity with technical problem-solving, always seeking new challenges and pushing my design skills further. I particularly like [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/)
- Hiking (and walking)
    - I find solace and rejuvenation in spending time outdoors. Whether it's a challenging climb to a sight seeing spot or a stroll through a city park, I appreciate the opportunity to connect with nature and enjoy its beauty firsthand. Hiking not only keeps me physically active but also clears my mind.

- Turn-Based Strategy Games
    - I'm an avid player of turn-based strategy games and have been since the 90's. I'm drawn to their complex mechanics, strategic depth, and the satisfaction of outmaneuvering opponents (usually NPCs). Games like [Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)), [XCOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM:_Enemy_Unknown) and [Into the Breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Breach) really help provide an outlet for blowing off steam while challenging my brain. I'd also be lying if I said I didn't play a lot of Persona.

    - I'm quite interested in the history of scientific discoveries and the individuals who made them possible. I enjoy exploring how scientific thought has evolved over time, uncovering the stories behind groundbreaking innovations, and understanding the impact these advancements have had on society.

- Fantasy
    - I find escape and adventure in the imaginative worlds of fantasy literature. Intricate storylines, compelling characters, and epic battles transport me to realms beyond reality, allowing me to explore themes of good versus evil, heroism, and the power of imagination.

- Science Fiction
    - Science fiction fuels my curiosity about the future and the possibilities that lie ahead. I'm captivated by stories that explore the implications of emerging technologies, alternate realities, and the potential impact of scientific advancements on humanity.
